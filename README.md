# Adaptive Multi-sensor Integration for Autonomous vehicles (GNSS/INS/LiDAR/HD Map)

- INS: Pose Predictor
- LiDAR: Mapping with real-time point clouds and offline point clouds 
- HD Map: Pre-built offline point cloud map

This package is under development. Currently, the mapping between the LiDAR and HD Map is provided by Autoware. This is curently robust with: INS/LiDAR/HD Map

-state vector: 
-state = [px, py, pz, vx, vy, vz, qw, qx, qy, qz, acc_bias_x, acc_bias_y, acc_bias_z, gyro_bias_x, gyro_bias_y, gyro_bias_z]
-control = [acc_x,acc_y,acc_z,gyro_x,gyro_y,gyro_z]
-measurement=[lx,ly,lz,lqw,lqx,lqy,lqz]
